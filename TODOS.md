# TODOs

Might be kind of important actually:

- [ ] Add custom error type
- [ ] Fix all `unwrap()` into real errors and handle them
- [ ] Test out every negative scenario
- [ ] _Misc:_ Change path input as string into `... -> impl Path`

App (tui):

- [ ] Add a new main window component (might move FolderTreeComponent into this)
- [ ] Divide windows so that each component has a window
- [ ] Make arrow functionality (so that we can move between windows)
- [ ] Add tabs (main, history, + others...)

CommandComponent:

- [ ] Add Commands for each window and print it out when a window is active (think about how to do this, check: gitui)

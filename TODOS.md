# TODOs

Insert new stuff:
1. Add folder insertion in FolderTree
2. Add endpoint insertion in FolderTree
3. Add folder folding of currently selected item (so add self.current as well or sth like that?)
4. (Optional) Add extensive testing

FolderTreeComponent:
1. Add new component and its basic functionality (such as making new obj from file, then selecting different stuff etc)
2. Do a `DrawableComponent` like gitui for it and see if it displays correctly
3. Fix some stuff (Im sure there will be a lot) and check functionality
